- Dashboard Insights â€“ Medical Appointment No Shows
  
   This dashboard analyzes the Kaggle dataset "Medical Appointment No Shows" and reveals the following insights:

- Gender
  
  Female patients have more appointments than male patients.
  
  However, the no-show rate is nearly the same for both genders, meaning gender is not a strong predictor of attendance.
  

- Chronic Conditions
  
  Patients with chronic conditions are more likely to attend their appointments compared to those without.
  
  Among chronic conditions, alcoholism has the highest no-show rate.
  

- Scholarship
  
  35% of patients with a scholarship miss their appointments, compared to 27% without scholarships.
  
  This indicates patients without scholarships show up more often.
  

- SMS Reminder
  
  Patients who do not receive an SMS reminder have a higher no-show count (>10k) compared to those who do (~10k).
  
  However, the difference is small, suggesting SMS reminders are not a strong factor in attendance.
  

- Appointment Day
  
  Most appointments are scheduled on Tuesday and Wednesday, and these days also see higher no-show counts.
  
  No-show rates:
  
      Monday: 30%
  
      Friday: 29%
  

- Time Gap Between Scheduling and Appointment
  
  The shorter the gap, the higher the likelihood of attendance.
  

- Handicap
  
Patients with disabilities tend to show up more often than those without.


- Neighborhood
  
Most neighborhoods have an ~80% attendance rate, but some (e.g., GURIGICA) have a much higher no-show rate (38.37%).



- Conclusion
  
     This study of medical appointment no-shows found that gender does not really affect whether people show up for their appointments.
  
  Instead, things like having a chronic illness, getting financial help (a scholarship), and where you live matter more.
  
  People with long-term health problems or disabilities are more likely to come to their appointments. People with scholarships or living in certain neighborhoods

  are more likely to miss theirs. Sending SMS reminders and choosing certain days of the week do not make a big difference, but making sure the waiting time
  
  between booking and the appointment is short does help people show up. These findings mean that clinics can focus more on helping those groups, reducing delays, and supporting neighborhoods
  
  with high no-show rates to improve attendance and patient care.
